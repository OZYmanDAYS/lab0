        <h2>Here are some of my favorite shows and movies</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <img src="./darkknight.jpg"/>
                <em>The Dark Knight</em> by Christopher Nolan is an absolute masterpiece and my favorite movie of all time,
                solely because of Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker.
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="./descendants.jpg"/>
                Regarded by many as the best Korean drama series of all time, <em>Descendants of the Sun</em> was
                one of my first forays into the world of Asianovelas and has kept me hooked ever since.
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="./psych.jpg"/>
                <em>Psych</em> was the one show that everyone in my family could agree to sit down and watch together
                because it was so damn funny and starred a genuinely hilarious black lead.
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="./wind.jpg"/>
                Before cheesy romance movies, there was the OG <em>Gone With the Wind</em> with all of the cheesy romance
                tropes before they officially became cheesy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="./suits.jpg"/>
                <em>Suits</em> was the first drama series that I ever watched, which says a lot because most of the shows 
                I had watched up until then were either cartoons or actiony.
