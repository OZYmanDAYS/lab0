                    <br>
                    Regarded by many as the best Korean drama series of all time, <em>Descendants of the Sun</em> was
                    one of my first forays into the world of Asianovelas and has kept me hooked ever since.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <em>The Dark Knight</em> by Christopher Nolan is an absolute masterpiece and my favorite movie of all time,
                    solely because of Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <em>Psych</em> was the one show that everyone in my family could agree to sit down and watch together
                    because it was so damn funny and starred a genuinely hilarious black lead.

                    <br>
                    Before cheesy romance movies, there was the OG <em>Gone With the Wind</em> with all of the cheesy romance
                    tropes before they officially became cheesy.

                    <br>
                    <em>Suits</em> was the first drama series that I ever watched, which says a lot because most of the shows 
                    I had watched up until then were either cartoons or actiony.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <em>Captain America: Winter Soldier</em> was and still is my favorite entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
                    because of its intrigue and subterfuge (and killer costume design).
