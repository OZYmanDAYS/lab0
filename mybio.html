        <h1>Welcome to my life</h1>
        <p>
                My name is Adewale Adewuyi. I am a third-year Harvard student living in the great Lowell House.
                I was raised in a sprawling suburb of Dallas located in the great state of Texas. I am concentrating
                in Computer Science with a secondary in Economics, and I want to use that degree to start and sell at
                least 4 companies by the age of 40 and become one of the sharks in Shark Tank. As I was writing this
                blurb, I realized how hard it is to write your own story in a concise fashion, and as such, have developed
                tremendous respect for people who have written autobiographies. Bravo. You deserve a clap.
